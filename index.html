      <p>
        I'm always excited to meet people who are optimistic about the future, think that we can be so much more
        than we are now, and have experience with bringing dreams into the physical world.
      </p>
      <p>I live in El Segundo, CA and am always down to host friends or friends of friends who are traveling to the area.</p>
